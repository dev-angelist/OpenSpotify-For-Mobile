# OpenSpotify-For-Mobile

- First, you need: any "Chrome based" browser which support "extensions". f.e. Brave and Kiwi Browser.

- Install an extension to run scripts like: Tampermonkey and Violentmonkey.

- If you want to insert the script with "one click" you can install it from this link: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/458371-openspotify-for-mobile
- Otherwise, you can copy and paste it from the reference on Github: https://github.com/dev-angelist/OpenSpotify-For-Mobile/blob/main/OpenSpotify_Script

- Finally, go to Open Spotify, log in or register and you can listen to the music you want for free.
